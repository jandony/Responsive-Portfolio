            <p>Hello everyone! My name is Jeff Andony and I am 24 years old. I currently am living in Thornton, Colorado
                and seeking to become a profession Full-Stack Developer. I graduated out of Arizona State University
                where I earned my degree in Graphic Information Technology from Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering. My
                creativity and entrepreneurial spirit has even carried over to the gym, where I spend my free time
                running SmartBOD, his fitness consultation company, to help others improve their health.</p>
            <p>While I have many knowledge in photography and graphic design, web development will just add that "icing
                on the cake" to help clients, companies, friends, and families with design projects of any kind.</p>
            <p>With experience in the design, sports, health, and fitness industries, my ultimate dream is to maintain
                my own creative agency in the fitness industry. This goal will allow me to utilze everything I have
                learned throughout my real-world experiences and educational career.</p>
